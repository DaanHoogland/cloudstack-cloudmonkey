Apache CloudStack CloudMonkey Changelog
---------------------------------------

Version 5.2.0
=============
This release includes
 - Network requests and shell related bugfixes
 - Based on platform, it will install either pyreadline (Windows) or readline (OSX and Linux)
 - Config param removal of `protocol`, `host`, `port`, `path`; uses `url` for the mgmt server URL
 - Introduces server profiles so users can use cloudmonkey with different hosts and management server configs

Make sure you backup your config before you upgrade cloudmonkey from previous releases.
With this release `cloudmonkey` will automatically fix your config file, add missing
configuration parameters and save it as the upgraded versions starts for the first time.

Version 5.1.0
=============
This release includes
 - support for using username and password instead of / in addition to api key and secret key
 - Usage of signature version 3 for the api signing process. This reduces the chance of API replay attacks
 - cleanup based on reporting from PEP8 and Flake8

If you upgrade from 5.0, then cloudmonkey will ask you to update your config file (~/.cloudmonkey/config)
Under the [user], you can add
username =
password =
Under the [server], you can add
expires = 600

Version 5.0.0
=============
This is the first release of CloudMonkey independent from the Apache CloudStack core orchestration engine. The release
includes a precache of Apache CloudStack 4.2.0 API calls, and should be backward compatible with prior 3.x and 4.x
CloudStack installations (with the obvious caveat that previous versions will have a subset of the latest API commands /
parameters).
